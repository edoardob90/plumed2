Version 2.4 (coming soon)
----------------------------

Version
2.4 contains several improvements with respect to 2.3. Users currently working with 2.3
should have a look at the section "Changes leading to incompatible behavior" below and
might need tiny adjustments in their input files.
Notice that version 2.4 includes already all the fixes in branch 2.3 up to 2.3.2 indicated in \ref CHANGES-2-3 .

\warning This is an alpha release!

\warning Notice that this list is not complete yet

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - A c++11 compliant compiler is required (see \issue{212}). This should mean:
    - gcc 4.8
    - clang 3.3
    - intel 15
    Since the number of c++11 features that we use is limited, older compilers might work as well.
- The meaning of BIASFACTOR=1 in \ref METAD has been modified and can now be used to indicate unbiased
  simulations. Non-well-tempered metadynamics is BIASFACTOR=-1, which is the new default value.
  Notice that this has an implication on the biasfactor written in the HILLS file when doing
  non-well-tempered metadynamics.
- Due to a change in \ref COMMITTOR, the format of its output file has been slightly changed.
- \ref HISTOGRAM : When using weights default is now to output histogram divided by number of frames from which data was taken.  In addition the 
  UNORMALIZED flag has been replaced with the keyword NORMALIZATION, which can be set equal to true, false or ndata.
- Sharing coordinates and applying force is now faster (in some cases these can result in much better scaling of the performances in parallel).
- New modules:
  - A new EDS module have been included, contributed by Glen Hocky and Andrew White.
    This module implements the following methods:
    - \ref EDS
- New collective variables:
  - \ref DIMER (thanks to Marco Nava).
  - \ref IMPLICIT : EEF1-SB implicit solvent solvation energy
  - \ref ADAPTIVE_PATH : Adaptive path variables using the method from \cite BerndAdaptivePath
- New actions:
  - \ref INENVELOPE
  - \ref TOPOLOGY_MATRIX
  - \ref BOND_DIRECTIONS
  - \ref DUMPGRAPH
  - \ref GRID_TO_XYZ
  - \ref INTEGRATE_GRID
  - \ref LWALLS
  - \ref MAXENT
  - \ref MCOLV_COMBINE
  - \ref MCOLV_PRODUCT
  - \ref POLYMER_ANGLES
  - \ref XANGLES , \ref YANGLES , \ref ZANGLES
  - \ref XYTORSIONS , \ref XZTORSIONS , \ref YXTORSIONS , \ref YZTORSIONS , \ref ZXTORSIONS , and \ref ZYTORSIONS
- New command line tools:
  - \ref pesmd : Tool for performing Langevin dynamics on an energy landscape that is specified using a PLUMED input file
  - \ref pathtools 
- Other changes:
  - \ref COMMITTOR : new flag to use committor to keep track of the visited basins without stopping the simulation
  - \ref PBMETAD : multiple walkers using files (thanks to Marco De La Pierre).
  - \ref PBMETAD : adaptive gaussians
  - \ref PBMETAD : default names for GRID and FILE (usefull with many collective variables) 
  - \ref METAD : BIASFACTOR=1 is allowed and performs unbiased sampling. HILLS file can be used
    to recover free energy also in this case.
  - \ref METAD : added options to perform Transition Tempered Metadynamics (thanks to James Dama)
  - PDB files with more than 100k atoms can now be read using [hybrid 36](http://cci.lbl.gov/hybrid_36/) format,
    see \issue{226}.
  - Trajectories read in \ref driver also support the usual replica convention, that is if
    trajectory with replica suffix is not found the driver will look for a trajectory without the replica suffix.
  - Internal molfile implementation has been updated to VMD 1.9.3.
  - Examples in the documentation now have syntax highlighting and links to the documentation of used actions.
  - \ref COORDINATIONNUMBER : Added option to have pairwise distance moments of coordination number in the multicolvar module

Changes from version 2.3 which are relevant for developers:
  - A few fixes has been made to improve exception safety. Although we still cannot declare
    PLUMED totally exception safe (there are still many non-safe pointers around),
    this made it possible to add a regtest that actually tests erroneous cmd strings
    and erroneous inputs.
  - Due to the required c++11 support, travis-ci test on Ubuntu Precise has been removed.
  - `gettimeofdate` and `gettime` have been replaced with portable `chrono` classes introduced in c++11.
  - C++ exceptions are enabled by default.
  - Stack trace is not written upon error anymore, unless environment variable `PLUMED_STACK_TRACE` is set at runtime.
  - Fixed a potential bug using single precision system blas on a mac (notice that currently plumed only uses
    double precision, so it is harmless).
  - Added `--enable-rpath` option for autoconf (off by default).
  - Files related to changelog are now stored as `.md` files. This makes
    it possible to navigate them from github.

Fixes after alpha release:
  - Fixed a bug in \ref LOCAL_AVERAGE which appears when you use SPECIESA and SPECIESB keywords instead of just SPECIES
  - All switching functions are now stretched by default, also when using the "simple syntax" (e.g. `COORDINATION NN=6`).
    Switching functions were already stretched by default when using the advanced syntax (e.g. `COORDINATION SWITCH={}`)
    since version 2.2.  Notice that this will introduce small numerical differences in the computed switching functions.
  - Added experimental lepton support. Set env var `export PLUMED_USE_LEPTON=yes` to activate lepton as a matheval replacement.
    Notice that this is an experimental feature and is not fully validated yet. See \issue{244}.
  - When parsing constants, PLUMED uses lepton library. This allows to pass
    arguments such as `HEIGHT=exp(0.5)`.
